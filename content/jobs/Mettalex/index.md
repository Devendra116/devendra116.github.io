- Built and deployed an agent-based cross-chain bridge from scratch, transferring `$1.8M worth of MTLX` tokens from BSC to Ethereum after the AnySwap bridge shutdown. Developed 3 smart contracts, complete backend infrastructure, and serverless cloud functions.
- Developed 15+ smart contracts across EVM (Solidity) and Cosmos (Rust) chains for an agent-based P2P OrderBook DEX where users deposit into escrow, off-chain agents match trades, and contracts handle settlement.
- Built Node.js and Python backend systems with webSocket integration for real-time orderbook updates coordinating agent logic and syncing on-chain/off-chain state.
- Created custom blockchain indexers for EVM and Cosmos chains to track events and maintain cross-chain state consistency for agent decision-making and live trading graphs.
- Stress-tested the system simulating up to 5,000 concurrent agents to identify bottlenecks and inform architecture improvements.
