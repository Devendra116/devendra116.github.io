Worked as a Remote virtual intern at Future Ready Talent. Future Ready Talent is a virtual internship platform with an opportunity to learn the in-demand azure cloud & security skills aligned to industry needs. What I did here :

- Build a platform that takes video to understand sentiments, behavioral polarity, Person Identification, Caption generation, and more.
- Used 3+ Azure services like Azure Blob Storage for Storing video, Azure Video analyzer for Sentiment Analysis, Caption Generation and Azure Web Hosting for hosting the project on the Azure cloud
